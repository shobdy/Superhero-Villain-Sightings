ONGOING ISSUES______________________________________________________________________
2019-02-01 3:31PM CST - Everything seems to be working OK. Need to make it more pleasing to the eye now.




COMPLETED ISSUES_____________________________________________________________________

2019-01-16 - Future option. Factor out the PersonOrganization create and edit in the PersonController to new method at the bottom to clean up code.
    2019-01-18 - Completed and tested, works fine.
2019-01-19 8:30AM CST - Figure out how to make the create column appear on top when screens are smaller.
    2019-01-18 8:50AM CST - Done - Learned new feature in Bootstrap. Pull col you want on top first in code, then add to class something like 'col-md-push-6'. 
    Then add similar code to other column like 'col-md-pull-6'. This pushes the top code to the right and pulls bottom code to the left.
2019-01-18 9:30AM CST - Added hr between each create and list columns to help differentiate and it hides an col-md and col-lg. Works fine.
    Used the classes hidden-md and hidden-lg
2019-01-18 10:00AM - Add back button to all screens that need it. Used js to have it go back.
    Create button and set onclick="goBack()". Added link to new js I created - <script src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/js/SHSightingsScripts.js"></script>
    Added this to js file: function goBack(){window.history.back();}
    Modified the layout to have back button on left and Update on right by adding to the update button class 'pull-right'.
2019-01-19 2:20PM CST - Move logout from the old spot to top right corner.
    2019-01-20 5:30PM CST - Moved the logout to the top right corner on the same line as the h1 title. Had to convert the h1 to a span class="h1" and add class to the h4 to 'pull-right'.
2019-01-20 5:30PM CST - Trying to get the favicon.ico to work for all webpages. This is icon in title bar of browser.
    Asked on slack after research didn't help. I think the issue is in the Spring MVC setup that SWG has us use.
    2019-01-21 3:00PM CST - Worked with Austyin Hill for a while and finally think I have it beat. Looks like the app wasn't liking the .ico I created. 
        I create a .png version and linked to it. Seems to have worked. Having Austyn test also when she gets back.
        Austyn checked and said it worked fine for her.
2019-01-24 4:58PM CST - Trying to add checkbox to let user know what users are disabled. and can enable/disable with just a click. Use JS for that.
    2019-01-28 1:01AMP CST - Had too much of a time with it. I have the table saying Yes/NO for the enabled and admin.
        In the edit page, I have it there where you can enable and set as admin. Tested Fine.
2019-01-21 12:24PM CST - Add an edit to the user to be able to change name and password without having to delete and recreate.
    Having a hell of a time getting the authorities list populated. Left off in the display part of UserController.
    2019-01-27 4:38PM CST - Finally got the Edit page working. Need to get the Update Password Page working.
    2019-01-28 1:28PM CST - Got edit and password pages working.
2019-01-24 3:57PM CST - Need to figure out if I can check for existing user and send message through annotation.
    2019-01-28 3:00PM CST - I am proud of this one. In UserController, I created an if statement that checks users for existing username, then pass:
        result.rejectValue("username", "DuplicateUser", "Duplicate user, please select another username.");
        This line creates the error message and puts in result to go to the next part that tests for errors. Works great!
2019-01-18 11:00AM CST - Need to figure out how to dynamically limit text length depending on screen size for description field.
    Been trying to do it with javascript. It works but you have to manually refresh every time you change screen size.
    Need to research how to trigger the function. Maybe window.onresize and/or window.onload? is there one for screen rotate?
    2019-01-31 8:53AM CST - After asking for help on slack, I finally got an answer I could use. 
        Phil Williams pointed me to an article that does it the way I wanted using only css.
        I added to my code and it worked great. Put the code snippet in my evernote file.
2019-01-21 2:45PM CST - Add a login link to top right of the app on home tab, Person list page and Person Details page. The rest are blocked by security.
    2019-01-21 4:30PM CST - added the login link and it works except it redirects to home page instead of page you were on when you clicked it.
        Need to see if I can figure out the redirect later.
    2019-02-01 3:09PM CST - Made it to where if you log in or log out, it will take you to the home tab every time. 
        Figured it was a good compromise for now.
